# STRIKE
STRIKE : Strategic Tracing &amp; Resilient Intelligence Kinetic Engine
STRIKE: Strategic Tracing & Resilient Intelligence Kinetic EngineOverviewSTRIKE is a powerful, open-source framework designed for comprehensive, multi-layered observability. Built on a robust stack of industry-leading tools, it provides a holistic view of your systems, from low-level infrastructure to high-level business metrics. With STRIKE, you gain the strategic intelligence needed to ensure the performance, reliability, and security of your entire technology stack.Key FeaturesFull-Stack Observability: Monitor Java Spring Boot applications, C++, Python, and any other language-agnostic applications by integrating with Prometheus via both scraping and pushing metrics.Infrastructure & Network Monitoring: Gain deep insights into the health of your servers, network devices, and other critical infrastructure components.Business Metrics Intelligence: Go beyond technical metrics by instrumenting your application code to capture business-critical data (e.g., transaction volume, user sign-ups, API call success rates), providing actionable intelligence for business decisions.Unified Visualization: All metrics are presented in elegant, customizable dashboards built with Grafana, offering a single pane of glass for all your monitoring needs.Automated Deployment & Configuration: Leverage the power of Ansible to automate the entire deployment process, from setting up servers to pushing and syncing configuration files for Prometheus and Grafana.Actionable Alerting: Receive timely and contextual alerts for anomalies and failures, enabling a proactive and rapid response to issues.ArchitectureSTRIKE's architecture is built on a proven, scalable, and modular stack:Prometheus: The core of the data collection engine. It scrapes metrics from configured endpoints and can receive metrics pushed from short-lived jobs.Alertmanager: Processes and routes alerts from Prometheus, enabling powerful grouping, deduplication, and routing to your preferred notification channels.Grafana: The visualization and dashboarding layer, providing a beautiful and intuitive interface for exploring your metrics.Ansible: The automation engine for deployment, configuration management, and ensuring the entire stack is in a consistent, desired state.Getting StartedFollow these steps to deploy and configure STRIKE.PrerequisitesA control machine with Ansible installed.Target servers for Prometheus, Grafana, and any application exporters you wish to deploy.Python 3.x on all target servers.Step 1: Clone the Repositorygit clone https://github.com/your-username/strike.git
cd strike
Step 2: Configure Your InventoryDefine your infrastructure in the ansible/inventory file. This is where you specify the servers for each component (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).[prometheus_servers]
prometheus_server_1

[grafana_servers]
grafana_server_1

[node_exporters]
host_1
host_2

# Add your application servers here
[java_spring_apps]
spring_app_1
Step 3: Define Metrics & DashboardsUse Ansible to manage your Prometheus and Grafana configurations.Prometheus Configuration: Edit the ansible/roles/prometheus/templates/prometheus.yml.j2 file to add new scrape jobs for your applications and services. The following is an example for a Java Spring Boot app:# In prometheus.yml.j2
- job_name: 'java_spring_apps'
  metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['spring_app_1:8080']
Grafana Dashboards: Store your Grafana dashboard JSON files in ansible/roles/grafana/files/dashboards/. The Ansible playbook will automatically sync these to your Grafana instance.Step 4: Run the Ansible PlaybookExecute the main playbook to deploy the entire STRIKE stack.ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory ansible/playbooks/site.yml
This single command will:Install Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.Push and sync all configuration files.Start all necessary services on your target servers.Step 5: Instrument Your ApplicationsTo monitor C++ or Python applications, you'll use a client library to expose metrics on an HTTP endpoint for Prometheus to scrape. For Java Spring Boot, you can use the built-in Prometheus Actuator.C++ Example: Use a library like prometheus-cpp to expose a metrics endpoint.Python Example: Use prometheus_client to expose metrics.Pushgateway: For short-lived jobs, use the Prometheus Pushgateway, which allows your applications to "push" metrics to Prometheus.Step 6: Access & VisualizeOnce the playbook completes, you can access your Grafana instance at http://<grafana_server_ip>:3000. Log in with default credentials (admin/admin), and you will find your pre-configured dashboards ready to go.ContributingWe welcome contributions!
