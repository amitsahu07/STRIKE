# STORM: Strategic Tracing & Resilient Intelligence Kinetic Engine

**STORM** is a comprehensive, end-to-end monitoring framework designed for modern, multi-language application environments. Built on a robust, industry-standard stack of **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, STORM provides the essential oversight needed to ensure the stability, performance, and reliability of your mission-critical systems.

With a focus on automation, all deployments and configurations are managed using **Ansible**, allowing you to set up and scale your monitoring infrastructure with a single command.

## üåü Features

  * **Holistic Monitoring:** Collect metrics from a wide range of sources, including **Java Spring, C++, Python, and other applications**.
  * **Flexible Data Collection:** Utilize **Prometheus** for both **pull-based scraping** of metrics from instrumented applications and **push-based collection** for ephemeral jobs or short-lived processes.
  * **Unified Visualization:** Create dynamic, real-time dashboards with **Grafana** to visualize infrastructure, application, network, and business metrics.
  * **Code-Level Metrics:** Instrument your applications to expose custom business metrics, giving you visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) from within your code.
  * **Full Automation:** Deploy the entire monitoring stack, including Prometheus, Grafana, exporters, and application configurations, using **Ansible playbooks**. This ensures consistency and reproducibility across all environments.
  * **Resilient Design:** The framework is built to be scalable and resilient, allowing it to handle high volumes of data from complex, distributed systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to get STORM up and running is with the provided Ansible playbooks.

### Prerequisites

  * **Ansible:** Ensure Ansible is installed on your control machine.
  * **Target Servers:** Have access to the servers where you will deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and various exporters.

### Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storm.git
    cd storm
    ```

2.  **Configure Ansible Inventory:**
    Update the `ansible/inventory` file with the hostnames or IP addresses of your target servers.

3.  **Run the Playbook:**
    Execute the main Ansible playbook to deploy the entire stack. This will install and configure Prometheus, Grafana, and common exporters.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory ansible/main.yml
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### Prometheus

  * The core metrics engine. Configured via Ansible to scrape metrics from:
      * **Node Exporter:** For host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk).
      * **JMX Exporter:** For metrics from Java applications (JVM, custom metrics).
      * **C++ & Python Exporters:** Use client libraries to expose metrics for scraping.
      * **Prometheus Pushgateway:** For metrics from batch jobs or short-lived processes.

### Grafana

  * The primary visualization tool. Ansible will automatically:
      * Install Grafana.
      * Set up the Prometheus data source.
      * Push and synchronize pre-built dashboards for a quick start.

### Ansible Playbooks

  * Organized into roles for modularity.
  * `prometheus_role`: Installs and configures the Prometheus server.
  * `grafana_role`: Installs and configures Grafana, including dashboard provisioning.
  * `exporters_role`: Installs and manages various exporters (Node, JMX, etc.) on target hosts.
